## Adorym

![Beyond DOF](https://github.com/mdw771/mdw771.github.io/raw/master/images/research_img_bdof.png "Beyond DOF")

Adorym standards for *A*utomatic *D*ifferentiation-based *O*bject *R*etrieval with d*Y*namic *M*odeling.
It is a modular Python framework that allows users to freely alter or create forward models in the
inverse problems that they want to solve. Adorym calculates the gradients for the customized model using
automatic differentiation -- the core technique enabling backpropagation in neural network training, 
and performs gradient-based optimization to iteratively solve the inverse problems.
