title: My repository of instructive IPython notebooks
---

This repository will be progressively populated with IPython (or Jupyter) Notebooks (IPNBs) that I made to demonstrate theories and practices in digital image processing, Python numerical computation, and Tensorflow usage. Check it out [here](https://github.com/mdw771/instructive_ipython_notebooks).
